## Preparation tasks

*Digital* or *Binary comparator* compares the digital signals A, B presented at input terminal and produce outputs depending upon the condition of those inputs. Complete the truth table for 2-bit *Identity comparator* (B equals A), and two *Magnitude comparators* (B is greater than A, B is less than A). Note that, such a digital device has four inputs and three outputs/functions.

```VHDL
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Architecture body for 4-bit binary comparator
------------------------------------------------------------------------
architecture Behavioral of comparator_4bit is
begin
    B_greater_A_o <= '1' when (b_i > a_i) else '0';
    B_equals_A_o  <= '1' when (b_i = a_i) else '0';
    B_less_A_o    <= '1' when (b_i < a_i) else '0';

end architecture Behavioral;
